# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that manages multiple different versions of a project and records all the changes made during development. It's useful because it allows users to recall specific versions at a later time.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a parallel version of a repository, an independent line diverged from the mainline of development. It is used to do work on different features/ aspects of a project because it doesn't affect the mainline.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records when a file has been added,deleted or changed to the repository. A good commit message is specific and descriptive.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an error that occurs if the same line in a file is changed differently or if a file has been deleted and modified because Git is unable to decipher which change is the correct one.
