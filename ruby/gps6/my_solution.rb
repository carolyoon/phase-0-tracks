=begin
  
1. In state data, the first hash uses hash rockets to convey the key, value relationship and the other uses ":" which can't be used when following a string.
2. Require_relative takes the relative file path of another file so the contents are available 
as if copy pasted onto the current file. Require does the same thing but needs an absolute file path
to access that particular file.
3. Use .map or for loops/iteration use .each
4. The variables within the method were already instantiated and therefore accessible to the methods without
being passed in as parameters/arguments.
5. Refactoring and using hashes as nested data structures.
